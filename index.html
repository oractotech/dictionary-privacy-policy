  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Dictionary app developed by Oracto Tech.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>This app does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal user information. It is fully offline and uses a local database for translated word lookup.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app uses the <code>RECORD_AUDIO</code> permission only to support voice input functionality for searching English words. This audio input is used locally on the device and is not stored or transmitted anywhere.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app does <strong>not use any third-party services or SDKs</strong> that collect user data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app does not knowingly collect data from children. As no data is collected at all, the app is safe for all age groups.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:oractotech@gmail.com">oractotech@gmail.com</a></p>
